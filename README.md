An Application for Optimized Configuration Testing

#Purpose
Dell products have complex configurations that include many parameters and values, there are several kinds of restrictions on those parameters and their values. This complexity is manifested in complex testing environments and thousands of configuration options that require testing. The goals of this system is to:

Document the configuration options for each product release
Minimize the number of configurations to test by connecting the system to a tool that will create the minimum set of configurations that require testing, with priority
Knowledge conservation of the planned testing environments
